# JavaScript UI & Temporal Scaffolding System

Mathematical approach to rhythm generation using JavaScript in Max/MSP.

## Core Concept

**Mathematical functions define temporal relationships, not just rhythmic patterns.**

```
Input: f(x) where x âˆˆ [0,1] (normalized time)
Process: Function evaluation across quantized steps  
Output: Onset timings for musical events
```

## Structure

- **temporal-system/**: Mathematical foundations and algorithms
- **jsui-implementation/**: JavaScript UI components and visualization
- **mathematical-foundations/**: Function libraries and detection methods
- **examples/**: Working implementations and demonstrations

## Vision

Bridge pure mathematics with musical time through intuitive visual interfaces.
