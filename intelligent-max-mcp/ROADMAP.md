## Development Notes

### Key Dependencies
```
mcp-sdk >= 1.0.0
requests >= 2.28.0
jsonschema >= 4.0.0
numpy >= 1.21.0  # For mathematical function generation
```

### Repository Integration Points
- `meta-programming/json-format/` - Core patcher structure knowledge
- `jsui-temporal-scaffolding/` - Mathematical music generation
- `max-reference-findings/` - Discovered patterns and optimizations

### Next Steps
1. Set up basic MCP server framework
2. Create connection to minutiae repository
3. Implement first generation functions
4. Test with temporal scaffolding examples
